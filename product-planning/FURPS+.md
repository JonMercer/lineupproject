# Fill this out

  **BASIC**

  -Count Up When a patient signs in, the button up is pressed and total number goes up
  
  -Count Down- When a patient leaves after seeing the doctor, or misses their spot the total number goes down
  
  -Reset To reset the machine after update or at the end of the day. Also resets total number.
  
  
  -Update Updates the newest version of the software to the machine

  -Calender- When checking in from the app, open a secondary tab to view what special events this business may have coming up.these events may be added via login on our site or linked through fb

  - Save a spot function. Click on a save your spot button to automatically log yourself into their line-up. Don't miss being called or you lose your spot! Fill out a form with basic info (required by business) and this will be pushed to the desktop at the business.
  
  -Full House- Businesses like restaurants would need a "Full House" button/option, perhaps by holding the up button. This sets it into full house mode while they are simply too busy to count. This will show on the site as (just a few seats left!)
  -Cloud & Handheld Functionality- With Bars and Nightclubs they probably wont need/want a screen hanging around with a number displaying on it. This kicks everything into hand-held counters and the cloud.
